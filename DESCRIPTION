Description: Statistical tools to build predictive models
    for the breeders community. It aims to assess the genetic value of
    individuals under a number of situations, including spatial
    autocorrelation, genetic/environment interaction and competition. It is
    under active development as part of the Trees4Future project, particularly
    developed having forest genetic trials in mind. But can be used for animals
    or other situations as well.
