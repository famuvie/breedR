\title{Extract the modes of the random effects}
\usage{
\method{ranef}{remlf90}(object, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{a fitted models with random effects of class
\code{\link{remlf90}}.}

\item{...}{not used}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{ranef.breedR} composed of a list of vectors,
  one for each random effect. The length of the vectors are the number of
  levels of the corresponding random effect.

  Each random effect has an attribute called \code{"se"} which is a vector
  with the standard errors.

  Additionally, depending of the nature of the random effect, there may be
  further attributes. The pedigree will be given for genetic random effects
  and the spatial prediction grid for the spatial random effects
}
\description{
Extract the conditional modes of the random effects from a fitted model
object.  For linear mixed models the conditional modes of the random effects
are also the conditional means.
}
\details{
This method is modeled a bit after \code{\link[lme4]{ranef}}. However, it is
independent and does not inherit from it. In particular, it always returns
the conditional variance (argument condVar in lme4).
}
\note{
To produce a (list of) \dQuote{caterpillar plots} of the random effects
  apply \code{\link{plot}} to the result of a call to \code{ranef}.
