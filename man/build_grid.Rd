\title{Build an encompassing grid}
\usage{
build_grid(coordinates, autofill = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{coordinates}{two-column matrix-like set of row and column coordinates
of observational units}

\item{autofill}{logical. If TRUE it will try to fill missing rows or columns
  with missing observations. Otherwise, will treat individuals as neighbours
  even if they are across an empty line.}
}
\value{
The parameters defining the grid, and the index of the observed
  coordinates in the grid seen as a vector. More specifically, \describe{
  \item{origin}{the coordinates of the \emph{first} (with smallest row and
  column values) point in the grid} \item{step}{the separation between rows
  and columns} \item{length}{the number of points in each dimension}
  \item{idx}{the index of each observation in the vectorized grid} }
}
\description{
Build the minimal regularly-spaced grid containing a given set of points.
